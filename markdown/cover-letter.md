Hi there,

I'm writing to apply for the backend developer job at OANDA. I'm a doctoral student in mathematics at the University of Toronto with a background in software development.

My core profile piece is a full-stack application **LexQuest** [www.lex.quest](www.lex.quest), which is a full-fledged SaaS web application, and which I developed every aspect of without exception, including

- Data acquisition
- Natural language processing to provide business value
- Relational database design
- Backend REST API
- React frontend featuring responsive design
- containerized deployment with Kubernetes
- integration with AWS Cloud services including e.g. SES

The source code is private but is available to review on a private Gitlab instance I've set up: [`gitlab.sacawa.net/psacawa/lektprojekt`](https://gitlab.sacawa.net/psacawa/lektprojekt) (**username:** _cv_, **password:** _demopass_).

I think that reviewing this project and my CV, you'll see that my web development skills are significant up and down the web stack. I'm eager to join your team and show my value.

Warm regards,

Paul Sacawa
